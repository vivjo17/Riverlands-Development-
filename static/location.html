      <h1>Growth in Motion</h1>
      <p>
        The area around Riverlands is rapidly evolving into a vibrant
        residential hub. Nearby Meridiana ranks among the nation’s
        fastest-growing master-planned communities and recently opened new
        campuses like Meridiana Elementary, Barbara Bennett Elementary, Jackie
        Doucet Caffey Junior High, and the adjacent Iowa Colony High School.

        developments include not only the Iowa Colony High School (opened 2022)
        but also a new Alvin ISD junior high slated for 2024—ensuring strong
        infrastructure for growing families.

      <h1>Grand Parkway (SH 99): A Game-Changer for Connectivity</h1>
      <p>
        The Grand Parkway (State Highway 99) is a future outer-loop highway that
        will significantly improve regional access. Segment B, stretching from
        I‑45 South to SH 288 near Rosharon, is environmentally approved and
        slated for construction to begin in Spring 2027, with completion
        anticipated by 2030. ABC13 Houston +6 Texas Department of Transportation
        +6 Wikipedia +6 Notably, the planned route passes just south of
        Riverlands, positioning Riverlands to benefit from major new transit
        infrastructure.

      <p>
        The surrounding area is poised for rapid growth with new schools,
        retail, and neighboring master-planned communities on the horizon.
        Riverlands provides a peaceful retreat that remains close to essential
        conveniences and future amenities.
