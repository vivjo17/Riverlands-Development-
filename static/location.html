        <h1>Connected to Houston</h1>
        <p>
          Nestled just off the newly expanded Meridiana Parkway, Riverlands
          offers residents easy access to SH 288 and a direct 22‑mile commute to
          Downtown Houston, including the Texas Medical Center—blending suburban
          peace with major metropolitan convenience.

        <h2>Growth in Motion</h2>
        <p>
          The area surrounding Riverlands is rapidly evolving into a vibrant
          residential hub. Nearby Meridiana ranks among the nation’s
          fastest-growing master-planned communities.
        </p>
        <p>Recent and planned school openings include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meridiana Elementary and Barbara Bennett Elementary</li>
          <li>Jackie Doucet Caffey Junior High</li>
          <li>Iowa Colony High School (opened 2022)</li>
          <li>New Alvin ISD junior high (opened 2024)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These developments ensure strong infrastructure for growing families.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h2>Grand Parkway</h2>
        <p>
          The future Grand Parkway (SH&nbsp;99) will pass just south of
          Riverlands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Segment&nbsp;B—from I‑45 South to SH&nbsp;288 near Rosharon—is
          environmentally approved with construction planned for 2027 and
          completion by 2030, unlocking convenient regional access.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the corridor develops, new retail and master-planned communities
          will bring expanded amenities while Riverlands retains a peaceful
          retreat close to Houston.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>Iowa Colony offers strong public schools and expanding amenities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Iowa Colony High School serves roughly 1,300 students with a
            16:1 ratio.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alvin ISD continues to add elementary and junior high campuses to
            meet rising demand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meridiana Elementary and other top-rated schools in Alvin ISD hold
            A-grade rankings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The broader area is poised for growth with new schools and retail on
          the horizon.

      <h2>Why Riverlands Stands Out</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Quick, stress-free access to Houston’s major job centers via Meridiana
          Parkway and SH 288.
        </li>
        <li>
          Best-in-class educational infrastructure, with new schools already

          Future-forward connectivity thanks to the upcoming Grand Parkway,
          improving long-term access for residents.
        </li>
        <li>
          A tranquil, low-density environment with opportunity for expansion as
          the area matures.
